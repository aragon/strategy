# Strategy to Become a Governance Hyperstructure

This strategy explains how Aragon can become a governance hyperstructure. The latest version of the full strategy can be read [here](strategy-governance-hyperstructure.md).

Future versions can be published here or forked into a new repo.

# Usage 

Aragon Association has used this strategy to inform its internal quarterly strategic planning and goal setting using the common OKR framework.

In context of a decentralized autonomous organization, it is still to be discovered how this strategy will be used or how to implement strategic planning in DAOs more broadly. Upon publication, it is expected that this strategy will be used by governance participants, such as proposal creators, delegates, or top token holders to signal the direction they would like for the project. In an environments that place a high degree of value on transparency, such as those with distributed leadership, public endorsements of strategy should be encouraged.

# Semantic Versioning

Products and organizations that are discovering themselves should respond to changes in the market and broader social and political climate with agility. They should make strategic pivots as needed, whether small or large. When strategy itself is evolving, there is risk of ambiguity regarding what precisely is being endorsed. Therefore, to increase transparency, strategies should be versioned, like software, and endorsed as such.

The following is a semantic scheme that will be used for this repo to increment the version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:

1. MAJOR version when you make changes that are incompatible with the organization and require a change in capital allocation, such as a strategic pivot
2. MINOR version when you add new content to the strategy, such as new evidence to support a hypothesis, argumentation, or strategic initiatives
3. PATCH version when you make communications improvements, such as formatting, grammar, spelling, typos, and other “bugs”
